**Description:** Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies, which are frequently used for natural language modeling and speech recognition. This tutorial covers the conceptual basics of LSTMs and implements a basic LSTM in TensorFlow. The second part of the tutorial introduces the basics of TensorFlow, an open-source software package used for implementing neural networks.
