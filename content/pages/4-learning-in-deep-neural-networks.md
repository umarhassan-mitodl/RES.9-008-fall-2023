**Taught by:** *Phillip Isola, MIT (June 17, 2015)* 

**Video:** [Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/bL1Zymz1b7g) (1:26:25)

**Description:** Introduction to using and understanding deep neural networks, their application to visual object recognition, and software tools for building deep neural network models.

**Slides:** [Using and Understanding Deep Neural Nets (PDF)](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/learning-hub/deep_learning_tutorial_2015.pdf)

**Additional Resources:**

- [Exercises](http://people.csail.mit.edu/phillipi/deep_learning_tutorial/doc/instructions.html)
- [Code for exercises](http://people.csail.mit.edu/phillipi/deep_learning_tutorial/matlab_exercises.zip) - Click on link to download, open MATLAB, change current directory to the downloaded folder, and then run setup; (this compiles the C code needed for MatConvNet). If you have difficulties, confirm that you have a working C compiler (check that the MATLAB mex command works). You may need to install [Windows SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279) and/or try using a more recent version of MATLAB.
