**Description:** Oscillatory neuronal synchronization has been hypothesized to provide a mechanism for dynamic network coordination. Rhythmic neuronal interactions can be quantified using multiple metrics, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This tutorial reviews current analysis methods used in the field of invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology to study the dynamic connections between neuronal populations. The tutorial first presents metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. A number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal-to-noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls are summarized and then illustrated through a series of MATLAB scripts, and ways to address these issues with current methods are then presented.
